Bamazon is a CLI tool that has 3 different modes with different abilities. The modes are:
 1. Customer. In customer mode, you can view all of the products for sale, including their prices and departments
 2. Manager. In manager mode, you can view all of the products available for sale, view products with low inventory (<5 units), add inventory to any product, or add a new item completely. 
 3. Supervisor. In supervisor mode, you can view product sales by department, as well as the total profit of the department which takes in to account the overhead costs of running each department. You can also add a new department in supervisor mode. 

To use, in your terminal window, simply type "node bamazon[Customer/Manager/Supervisor].js"
